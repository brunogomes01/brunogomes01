# Hi, I'm Bruno 👋

I’m a **Junior Cloud Engineer** at **NTT Data Europe & LATAM**, working at the intersection of **Cloud Engineering, DevOps practices, and FinOps**.

My role focuses on building, operating, and improving cloud environments with an emphasis on **automation, scalability, reliability, and cost efficiency**.

I hold a specialization in **Data Science and Artificial Intelligence**, which allows me to apply data-driven approaches to cloud operations, cost optimization, and infrastructure decision-making.

## 🚀 What I work on

- Cloud infrastructure operations with a **DevOps and SRE mindset**
- FinOps-driven cost visibility, optimization, and governance
- Monitoring, reliability, and continuous improvement of cloud platforms
- Automation and scripting to reduce manual effort and operational risk
- Incident management, troubleshooting, and root cause analysis
- Collaboration with engineering and business teams to align **technical decisions with financial impact**
